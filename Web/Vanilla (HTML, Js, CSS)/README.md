## Running the server

Please navigate to the `src` folder for the source-code of the website.

The `index.html` file is the starting point.

The website requires a webserver to function properly. You can use the built in
PHP server.

Assuming port `8080` is free.

```bash
$ php -S localhost:8080
```

This version of the website was tested with
`Google Chrome: Version 89.0.4389.114(Official Build) (x86_64)`
on the `Apple MacBook Pro 13in 2017` model running
`MacOS Big Sur: Version 11.2 (20D64)`.

The type of web server is not important as long as it points to the `src`
directory.

## Miscellaneous

Please note that other files that are not necessarily needed for the website
to run, they are required as part of the source code. These files are listed
below:

1. `.gitignore`: required for ignoring metadata, generated files and other junk
   that does not contribute to the website source-code.
2. `readme.md`: used as an entry point for the source-code.
