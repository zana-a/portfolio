- Identifier introduced, so it can be tested.
- Options removed since repetitions do not return a none
- moduleIdentifier removed so that naming is more expressive
- moved to idea based project. ultimately abandoned for lack of library automation
- Moved back to scala 2 for better tooling
- in some cases the parser needs whitespace such as mod-A-do where `-` is the white space. Without it, parser thinks it
  is part of the previous token.
- Statement parser removed as there was no need for it
- Rename to cond and loop was purely aesthetical and allows for room in future for c styled if and while if need be.
- static types introduced in order to make operations feasible
- static types introduced to give user more control over the type they assign to variables
- variables now have a mutability modifier so that by default things are immutable
- Loop removed as it can be rewritten as a recusrive cond function
- made variable type optional
- empty cond on function does not produce a result.
- the keywords tend to get in the way and should be handled with the negating parser.
